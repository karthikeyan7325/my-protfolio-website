        <h3>Oxygen Generation</h3>
        <p style="text-align:left; margin: 0 auto; max-width: 220px;"></p>
            The ocean plays a vital role in oxygen production, contributing roughly half of Earth's total oxygen supply through photosynthesis. This process, primarily carried out by marine phytoplankton, converts carbon dioxide and water into organic matter and releases oxygen as a byproduct.
        </p>
        <p>The ocean is a major source of oxygen for our planet, producing about 50% of the oxygen we breathe. Tiny organisms called phytoplankton, which live in the upper layers of the ocean, use sunlight to convert carbon dioxide and water into oxygen through photosynthesis. This process not only supports marine life but also helps maintain the balance of gases in the atmosphere, making the ocean essential for life on Earth.</p>

      <div class="card">
        <img src="images/ocean_co2.jpg" alt="CO2 Regulation" />
        <h3>CO2 Regulation</h3>
        <p style="text-align:left; margin: 0 auto; max-width: 220px;"></p>
            The ocean acts as a significant carbon sink, absorbing about 30% of the carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emitted into the atmosphere. This process helps regulate global climate by reducing the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> in the air.
        <p>The ocean plays a crucial role in regulating Earth's climate by absorbing large amounts of carbon dioxide (CO₂) from the atmosphere. Tiny organisms like phytoplankton use CO₂ during photosynthesis, helping to remove it from the air. Additionally, the ocean acts as a "carbon sink," storing CO₂ in deep waters for hundreds or even thousands of years. This natural process helps slow down global warming and keeps our planet's temperature more stable. Protecting marine life and ecosystems is essential to maintaining this powerful climate-regulating function of the ocean..</p>

      <div class="card">

        <h3>Food Source</h3>
        <p style="text-align:left; margin: 0 auto; max-width: 220px;"></p>
            The ocean provides a diverse range of food sources, including fish, shellfish, and seaweed, which are essential for human nutrition and livelihoods.
        <p>The ocean is one of the world's most vital sources of food, providing nutrition for billions of people. It is home to a wide variety of marine species like fish, shellfish, seaweed, and crustaceans that are rich in protein and essential nutrients. Coastal communities especially depend on the ocean for their daily meals and livelihoods. From small fish like sardines to large species like tuna, the ocean’s biodiversity supports global food security. Sustainable fishing and protecting marine habitats are key to ensuring that this precious food source remains available for future generations..</p>
